Thanks for downloading one of my add-on for Pterodactyl Panel.

It's very easy to install, basically you just need to upload all the files given to your Pterodactyl main file path.

Normally the main path is /var/www/pterodactyl

It will overwrite some files, that's totally fine because it rewrites the LoginController, Auth Routes and Views of Pterodactyl.

Once uploaded, it should be done. If it isn't, try a web server restart.
For Nginx: service nginx restart
For Apache2: service apache2 restart

If it still doesn't work, contact me on Discord or MC-Market. It will be a pleasure to help you out.
